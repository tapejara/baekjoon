### 문제 설명

<p>In the first quadrant of a coordinate plane, you are given $n$ line segments parallel to the $x$-axis. Each segment $S_i$ ($1 ≤ i ≤ n$) is represented by the coordinates of its left and right endpoints, $(l_i , y_i )$ and $(r_i , y_i )$, respectively. All coordinates are positive integers.</p>

<p>You must now answer $q$ queries. For each query, a vertical line $x = p$, parallel to the $y$-axis, is given. The vertical line is represented by a single positive integer $p$.</p>

<p>If each segment $S_i$ is horizontally extended, it will eventually meet the line $x = p$ at the point $(p, y_i )$. If the segment, including its endpoints, already meets $x = p$, no extension is needed. For example, suppose there are $5$ segments $\{(2, 3), (5, 3)\}$, $\{(4, 6), (9, 6)\}$, $\{(8, 2), (12, 2)\}$, $\{(11, 4), (13, 4)\}$, and $\{(14, 5), (17, 5)\}$, and a single line $x = 11$. The first segment must be extended by $6$ to the right, the second segment $2$ to the right, the third and the fourth segments $0$, and the fifth segment $3$ to the left for each to meet $x = 11$.</p>

<p>For each query, determine the maximum among the extension lengths required for all segments to meet the line $x = p$. Formally, let $\text{dist}(p, S_i )$ denote the distance that segment $S_i$ must be extended to intersect $x = p$ at $(p, y_i )$. For each query, output $\max_{1≤i≤n}{\text{dist}(p, S_i )}$. In the example above, the answer to the query is $6$. See the figure below.</p>

<p>Given $n$ segments and $q$ queries, write a program to output the maximum extension length for each query.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>Your program is to read from standard input. The input starts with a line containing two integers $n$ ($1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \times 10^6$) and $q$ ($1 ≤ q ≤ 2 \times 10^6$), where $n$ is the number of line segments and $q$ is the number of queries. In the following $n$ lines, the $i$-th line contains three integers, $l_i$, $r_i$, and $y_i$ ($1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9$; $1 ≤ y_i ≤ 10^3$), where $l_i$ (resp. $r_i$) is the $x$-coordinate of left (resp. right) endpoint of $S_i$ and $y_i$ is the $y$-coordinate of both endpoints of $S_i$. In the following $q$ lines of queries, the $j$-th line contains one integer $p_j$ ($1 ≤ p_j ≤ 10^9$) which denotes the vertical line $x = p_j$.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Your program is to write to standard output. Print exactly one line per each query. The $j$-th line should contain the maximum among the extension lengths required for all segments to meet $x = p_j$ at $(p_j , y_j)$.</p>
